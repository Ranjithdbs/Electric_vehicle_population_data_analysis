# Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis(Dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project Objective
Analyze EV adoption trends from 2011 to 2024, identifying popular models and regional distribution. Provide insights for infrastructure planning, market strategies, and policy decisions.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/Ranjithdbs/Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis/blob/main/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv">Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis</a>

## Problem Statement(KPI's)

1. Total Vehicles:
	 Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range:
   Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
   Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
   Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
   Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
   Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

## Key Insights:
  Strong growth in 2023 shows rising EV adoption, but the 2024 drop signals a possible data gap or market shift.
  Tesla's market dominance highlights its competitive edge, while other manufacturers hold smaller shares.
  Geographic disparities indicate a need for targeted infrastructure development in low-adoption states.
  The 67.83-mile average range suggests the presence of older or lower-range EVs, emphasizing the need for newer, long-range vehicles.
  CAFV eligibility data gaps highlight inconsistent reporting, which could impact policy and incentive accuracy.

## conclusion
  Analyzed EV population data, revealing a sharp growth trend in 2023 and Tesla’s market dominance (45.83%). Identified geographic disparities in EV adoption, with 
  Washington leading. Highlighted the need for infrastructure expansion and longer-range vehicles based on an average EV range of 67.83 miles
