# Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis(Dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project Objective
Analyze EV adoption trends from 2011 to 2024, identifying popular models and regional distribution. Provide insights for infrastructure planning, market strategies, and policy decisions.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/Ranjithdbs/Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis/blob/main/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv">Electric_vehicle_population_data_analysis</a>

## Problem Statement(KPI's)

1.Total Vehicles:
•	Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range:
•	Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
•	Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
•	Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
